                        Seek Medical Attention:
                     </b> 
                        If you've sustained a significant injury, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional 
                        for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and instructions closely.

                        Depending on the severity of your injury, you may need to rest the affected area to allow it to heal. 
                        Rest is crucial for recovery.

                        If you're experiencing pain, follow your healthcare provider's advice for pain management,
